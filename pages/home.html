							Studies show that COVID-19, common cold, seasonal allergies, and the flu have many similar signs and symptoms.
							If you have signs or symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19, it is essential to consult 
							a medical professional. But, not all of us can access medical services instantly. With the help of 
							machine learning, people with covid, flu, allergy, and common cold symptoms can check themselves before 
							they seek medical expertise. We are not aiming to provide medical diagnosis for people rather an educational
							one through the help of machine learning. We advise people not to take the results as fact but 
							rather as a guide for them to make correct medical decisions and always seek medical help if they are 
							experiencing those symptoms.
