# cfac19
Web application for classifying covid-19, flu, allergy, and cold using machine learning. The model was trained with the help of genetic algorithm.

CFAC-19 gives the common people the tool to instantly asssess themselves wether they have covid-19, flu, allergy, and cold. WE use 40,000 samples to ensure that the clasification 
is reliable. BUT, we are advising the users to consult the doctor and not take the result as a fact; instead use the result as a guide for them to make the 
right dessccions.
